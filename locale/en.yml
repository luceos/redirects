            description: >
                Rules with "Override Flarum" run before the forum routes while the other only run when Flarum encounters a 404 error.
                Rules are run in the order you define below, from top to bottom.
                The first matching rule will be used for the redirect.
                Check the complete documentation on <a>GitHub</a>.
